# Chapter 1
## Day 1

#### Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.

For me blockchain is a digital storage of information similar to database, but with some key differences:
1) It is consists of a blocks. They are connected together via cryptography and that makes a blockchain. Old blocks is more like a history of blockchain. And new blocks created when fresh information appears.
2) Blockchain is decentralized so the data is immutable (not always tho, depends on how much one is decentralized).

#### Explain what a Smart Contract is. 

Smart contract is a piece of code that deployed on a blockchain by developer. This program than primarily used to interact with a blockchain via transactions. Once deployed it can't be changed, so any bugs in the code are very crucial. And most of the time to fix something developer must deploy a new contract.

#### Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

Main difference is that transaction is a paid interaction with blockchain, means that it changes or writes data on blockchain. But script is used to view data that already stored on blockhain and not change anything on it.

## Day 2

#### What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

1. Safety and Security.
2. Clarity
3. Approachability
4. Developer Experience
5. Resource Oriented Programming

#### In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful?

Safety and Security is litterally "pillars" of our life. Noone will ever fly on an airplane or drive a car without it being safe. And noone will ever use online banking if it wasn't secure enough. So to developers write something on Cadence and to people use applications it first of all should be Safe and Secure on base level. Clarity is very important for users to understand a code of a contract on a base level. Also clarity aswell as approachability play a crucial role in learning new programming language. Developer experience is last but not the least. Good developer experience extends the first pillar (S&S) aswell as saves time to develop a contract and debug.
